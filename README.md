I'm trying to better understand the new code base I've just been given access to, which uses some tools I haven't used before. Among them is Next.js.

So I'm walking through the tutorial at [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) to get a handle on what, how, and why it does what it does.

I'm a little bit in love with their documentation and wishing that all docs were so well-written!
